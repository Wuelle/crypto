//! # What is qFALL-crypto?
//! qFall-crypto provides cryptographic basics such as mathematical primitives,
//! fundamental lattice-based cryptographic constructions, and samplable distributions/
//! possibilities to sample instances of lattice problems to prototype
//! lattice-based cryptographic constructions and more.
//!
//! Currently qFALL-crypto supports 3 main construction types:
//! - [Identity-Based Encryptions](construction::identity_based_encryption::IBEScheme)
//! - [Public-Key Encryptions](construction::pk_encryption::PKEncryptionScheme)
//! - [Signatures](construction::signature::SignatureScheme)
//!
//! These are identified by traits and then implemented for specific constructions, e.g.
//! [`RingLPR`](construction::pk_encryption::RingLPR).
//! Our library has further primitives useful for prototyping such as
//! [`PSFs`](primitive::psf::PSF) that can be used to implement constructions.
//!

//! ## Tutorial + Website
//! You can find a dedicated [tutorial](https://qfall.github.io/book/index.html) to qFALL-crypto on our [website](https://qfall.github.io/).
//! The tutorial explains the basic steps starting from installation and
//! continues with basic usage.
//! qFALL-crypto is co-developed together with qFALL-math which provides the basic
//! foundation that is used to implement the cryptographic constructions.
