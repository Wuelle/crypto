//! This module provides the trait a struct should implement if it is an
//! instance of a signature scheme. Furthermore, it contains cryptographic signatures
//! implementing the `Signature` trait.

pub mod fdh;
mod pfdh;

/// This trait captures the essential functionalities each signature scheme has to support.
/// These include
/// - `gen`: to generate a public key and secret key pair
/// - `sign`: which allows to create a signature for a message
/// - `vfy`: which allows to check if a signature is valid for a certain message
///
/// Note: The gen does not take in the parameter `1^n`, as this is a public parameter,
/// which shall be defined by the struct implementing this trait.
